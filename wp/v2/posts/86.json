Regular Dusting: Dust your leather upholstery regularly with a soft, dry cloth or vacuum it using a soft brush attachment to remove loose dirt and debris.<\/p>\n<p>2. Avoid Direct Sunlight: Protect your leather furniture from direct sunlight as it can cause fading and drying. Position your furniture away from windows or use curtains or blinds to shield it from the sun&#8217;s rays.<\/p>\n<p>3. Use a Leather Conditioner: Applying a leather conditioner every six to twelve months helps keep the material supple and prevents cracking. Follow the product instructions for the appropriate application method.<\/p>\n<h3>Cleaning Techniques for Leather Upholstery<\/h3>\n<p>1. Immediate Spill Cleanup: Blot spills on leather <a href=\"\/SpotGuard-Pro\/essential-dos-and-donts-of-upholstery-cleaning\/\">upholstery immediately with a clean<\/a>, dry cloth. Avoid rubbing the spill, as it may spread and become more difficult to remove.<\/p>\n<p>2. Mild Soap and Water: For general cleaning, mix a small amount of mild soap with water. Dampen a soft cloth with the solution and gently wipe the leather surface. Rinse the cloth and wipe again with clean water to remove any soap residue. Dry with a soft, dry cloth.<\/p>\n<p>3. Spot Cleaning: For stubborn stains, use a leather-specific cleaner following the product instructions. Test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure compatibility and avoid discoloration.<\/p>\n<h2>Fabric Upholstery<\/h2>\n<h3>Care Tips for Fabric Upholstery<\/h3>\n<p>1. Regular Vacuuming: Vacuum your fabric upholstery at least once a week to remove dust and dirt.

Rotation and Fluffing: Rotate and fluff your cushions regularly to distribute wear evenly and maintain the shape of the upholstery.<\/p>\n<p>3.

Be cautious when handling pets with sharp claws near the furniture.<\/p>\n<h3>Cleaning Techniques for Fabric Upholstery<\/h3>\n<p>1. Immediate Spot Cleanup: Blot spills on fabric upholstery immediately with a clean, absorbent cloth or paper towel.

Dampen a <a href=\"\/SpotGuard-Pro\/\">clean cloth with the solution and gently blot the stained<\/a> area. Rinse the cloth and repeat the process with clean water to remove any soap residue. Pat dry with a clean towel.<\/p>\n<p>3.
