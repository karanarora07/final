Protecting Outdoor Furniture<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.marthastewart.com\/thmb\/biXI_q-aMTZwgTCa-ggagr3WCbQ=\/1500x0\/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()\/outdoor-furniture-care-guide-0822-2000-3eeecc3f6a134d40bc7971ea5c6b5381.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Winter weather can be particularly damaging to outdoor furniture. To protect it, consider investing in covers or storing it in a sheltered area such as a shed or garage.

Cleaning and Maintenance<\/h3>\n<p>Winter is an excellent time to <a href=\"\/SpotGuard-Pro\/diy-furniture-cleaning-tips-for-revitalizing-your-living-space\/\">clean and maintain your furniture<\/a>. Wipe down the surfaces with a damp cloth and mild soap to remove any dirt or stains. Be sure to dry it thoroughly to prevent moisture from seeping into the wood.
